/*
A family tree is made up of the relations between the parents and the children. Assume that one of your grand-grand-parents have N number of children, and those children also have M number of children, and those children also have P number of children, and so on and on until there are no longer any children.
Think of a method that writes the name of an individual and then starts going through the list of the individualâ€™s children. It processes each child similarly; prints the name, and goes through the list of children, until of course, the individual does not have any.
Give the pseudocode for this method, but make sure you specify the inputs, output, and steps clearly.

Procedure PrintFamilyTree(individual):

        a. For each child of the individual:
            i. Call PrintFamilyTree(child) // Recursive call
