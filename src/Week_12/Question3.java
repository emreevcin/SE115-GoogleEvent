    Write a function that returns the position of a dropped object in a gravity field, as a function of gravity g, time and start position, and initial velocity. Use meters and seconds as your units. You will recall that the formula for the position as h= h0 + t*v0 - gt2/2. Define a constant g for earthâ€™s gravity as 9.8 meter/sec2 to be used as the default value.
