/*
    Question: The duration of a song can be represented by the number of minutes and the number of seconds of the songâ€™s length. These two values are always integers. For example, a song can be 3 minutes and 25 seconds long.
Write a function that accepts a list of duration values and returns the total duration.
Hint: Do not forget that a minute is 60 seconds long. There is no duration such as 3 minutes
and 100 seconds; that must be 4 minutes and 40 seconds.
